#### AI-native runtime

Engineered from the ground up for heavy AI workloads, built for super-fast autoscaling and model initialization and 100x faster than Docker.

#### Built-in storage layer

A globally distributed storage system built for high throughput and low latency. Designed for fast model loading, training data, or other datasets.

#### First-party integrations

Mount your existing cloud buckets, connect to MLOps tools, and send data to your existing telemetry vendors.

#### Multi-cloud capacity pool

Deep multi-cloud capacity with intelligent scheduling ensures you always have the CPUs and GPUs you need without managing input orchestration.

> “We use Modal to run edge inference with <10ms overhead and batch jobs at large scale. Our team loves the platform for the power and flexibility it gives us.”

Brian Ichter, Co-founder

> “Modal makes it easy to write code that runs on 100s of GPUs in parallel, transcribing podcasts in a fraction of the time.”

Mike Cohen, Head of Data

[Read Case Study](https://modal.com/blog/substack-case-study)

> “Everyone here loves Modal because it helps us move so much faster. We rely on it to handle massive spikes in volume for evals, RL environments, and MCP servers. Whenever a team asks about compute, we tell them to use Modal.”

Aakash Sabharwal, VP of Engineering

> “We've previously managed to break services like GitHub because of our load, so Modal handling our massive scale so smoothly means a lot. We trust Modal to keep up with our growth, and we're excited to build together in the long term.”

I've realized [@modal](https://x.com/modal) is actually a great fit for ML training pipelines.

If you're running model-based evals, why not just call a serverless Modal function and have it evaluate your model on a separate worker GPU? This makes evaluation during training really easy.

Bullish on [@modal](https://x.com/modal)

\- Great Docs + Examples
\- Healthy Free Plan (30$ free compute / month)
\- Never have to worry about infra / just Python

[@modal](https://x.com/modal) continues to be magical... 10 minutes of effort and the \`joblib\`-based parallelism I use to test on my local machine can trivially scale out on the cloud. Makes life so easy!

this should be how you deploy python apps. wow

This tool is awesome. So empowering to have your infra needs met with just a couple decorators. Good people, too!

special shout out to [@modal](https://x.com/modal) and [@\_hex\_tech](https://x.com/_hex_tech) for providing the crucial infrastructure to run this! Modal is the coolest tool I’ve tried in a really long time— cannnot say enough good things.

feels weird at this point to use anything else than [@modal](https://x.com/modal) for this — absolutely the GOAT of dynamic sandboxes

Used [@modal](https://twitter.com/modal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for the first time today - immediate "oh, this is how backends should work" moment, similar to using Vercel for the first time for frontend deployments.

Nothing beats [@modal](https://x.com/modal) when it comes to deploying a quick POC

I've realized [@modal](https://x.com/modal) is actually a great fit for ML training pipelines.

If you're running model-based evals, why not just call a serverless Modal function and have it evaluate your model on a separate worker GPU? This makes evaluation during training really easy.

Late to the party, but finally playing with [@modal](https://x.com/modal) to run some backend jobs.

DX is sooo nice (compared to Docker, Cloud Run, Lambda, etc). Just decorate a Python function and deploy. And it's fast! Love it.
